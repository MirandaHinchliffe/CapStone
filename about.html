        <p class="about">Here at our small business we faces different challenges, 
            they differ based on the materials we use to make our clothes, 
            the different fashion, finding recycled materials for some products, 
            but that isn't the only thing! 
            We are developing easier and less plastic consuming ways to devliver to you.
             We have switched our plastic bags for papertowel like bags,
              they are biodegradable and they have different kinds of flower seeds embedded within the paper so you can just burry the paper outside or in a pot!
               We are in the process of doing the same with our delivery boxes.</p>
        <P class="about1">In the next couple of months, 
            our team plans to start a page for donating to organizations we support incuding a percentage of items you buy.
             As well as reaching out to those in charge of those organizations raising money for those who are helping those in need of help,
              to those who are fighting to rebuild our forests, 
              and to those who are trying to help heal the heart of our polar ice caps as they are melting due to global warming causing climate change,
               to let them know we support them and the cause we are all trying to save.
                Our planet ‚ù§.</P>
